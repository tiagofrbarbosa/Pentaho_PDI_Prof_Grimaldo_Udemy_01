17552;Argentina;Black cherry and blackberry aromas are ripe, with a touch of prune weighing in. In the mouth, punchy acidity sticks out. Wiry raspberry and plum flavors are surprisingly tart and underdeveloped, while lactic oak notes and choppy acidity make for a jumbled finish.                                                                 ;Expresión                                                       ;86;14;Mendoza Province ;Mendoza                   ;                 ;Michael Schachner ;@wineschach     ;Mi Terruño 2012 Expresión Malbec (Mendoza)                                                        ;Malbec                    ;Mi Terruño                     ;Wine Malbec   
17638;Argentina;With ripe aromas of cough syrup, baked berry, cherry and smoke, this Malbec offers a bit of everything. The palate is full but has energy, and the flavors of boysenberry, blueberry and chocolate come in a big, pounding wave.

17700;Argentina;Dense berry aromas are a bit flat and medicinal. Expect a juicy, direct palate with hard plum and berry flavors that are also a touch briny/salty. A full finish loses its fruit fast, leaving ringing acidity and a lasting briny flavor.                                                                                              ;[+]                                                             ;84;10;Mendoza Province ;Mendoza                   ;                 ;Michael Schachner ;@wineschach     ;Santa Julia 2013 [+] Malbec (Mendoza)                                                             ;Malbec                    ;Santa Julia                    ;Wine Malbec

18086;France   ;When some of the greatest Cahors weigh in at 13.5% alcohol, there is no need for this 15.5% monster. It's a shame, because there is much to admire here, with the powerful bitter chocolate and the sweetest berry fruits, a wall of polished concentration.
